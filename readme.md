# Reinforce

This is my Reinforcement Learning (RL) library.

At the moment, it is simply a personal playground that I set up to learn some technical and/or implementation details of RL algorithms. I hope that in time it could grow and become a mature product.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/mtortonesi/reinforce/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mtortonesi/reinforce/actions?workflow=Test)

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile (or gems.rb) by executing:

    $ bundle add reinforce

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install reinforce


## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
